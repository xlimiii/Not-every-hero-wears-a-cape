# Not-every-hero-wears-a-cape
C++/SFML project 




"Not every hero wears a cape" is a simple game written in C++ using SFML. 
This is our project for collage and first project in SFML. We were based on lots of tutorials, 
for example: Cziczak Academy, SFML 2.4 For Beginners, Sonar Systems Tutorial Series. 
The graphics were made in MS Paint.
The game is running the SFML-2.5.1 engine. 




GAME DESCRIPTION

The main character in our game is a bee (real hero :) ). The game's aim is to catch as many as possible flowers and to avoid bricks. 
Collision with a brick results in the end of the game.
